      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did not find any topic that can motivate me to pick up writing blogs for quite a while until I finished watching &lt;em&gt;Key the Metal Idol&lt;/em&gt; recently (maybe not that recent lol). My thinkings are kind of scattered so feel free to jump around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1633664492996.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;success-or-failure&#34;&gt;Success or Failure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I dislike connecting a really lowkey anime to a more popular one just to be able to say  &amp;ldquo;Ohhh this gives me a (insert popular anime name here) vibe!&amp;rdquo;, I would still argue that &lt;em&gt;Key the Metal Idol&lt;/em&gt; reminds me a lot of &lt;em&gt;Serial Experiments Lain&lt;/em&gt;. They are both psychological/sci-fi animes made in the 90s centered around the theme of technology and humanity with similar character arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I could see why &lt;em&gt;Lain&lt;/em&gt; tends to be more popular and has a higher rating. First of all, &lt;em&gt;Lain&lt;/em&gt; has successfully promoted itself to its target audiences, represented by the autistic computer nerds who won&amp;rsquo;t shut up about the 90s nostalgia. But &lt;em&gt;Key&lt;/em&gt;? It obviously does not belong to the mainstream and neither can it appeal to any particular communities due to its scattered big ideas. Second, &lt;em&gt;Lain&lt;/em&gt; is rather continuous on its style and keeps a steady pace on storytelling despite its heavy use of stream of consciousness. But &lt;em&gt;Key&lt;/em&gt;? It has a fast paced and exciting introduction, overlong and repetitious development, a 1 hour episode dedicated to a tedious conversation revealing the truth, with a ravishing yet unintelligible ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I could not criticize the directors for making it this way since it is just an OVA but not a formal TV series. My expectations tend to be lower for experimental stuff. I like it, but I would admit that the way they present it lacks some flavor. In another way, too plain. It has a powerful ending but the slow development could drive people back from watching it till the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it a success or failure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
Something in between. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely a failure according to the market but everything has met standards. I enjoyed it a lot, so I am going to say it&amp;rsquo;s a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will I recommend people to watch it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
Depends. If you have patience and don&amp;rsquo;t mind some obscure stuff, go for it; if not, then don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;idol-theory&#34;&gt;Idol Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key&lt;/em&gt; is not only a nice parody of the Japanese idol industry as its name suggests, but also an interesting piece that lets you think about what idols are and how the relationship between idols and their followers differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the story develops, the definitions of idols also evolve, represented by Miho and the Mima women &amp;amp; Key. A gradual transformation of idols is revealed through the most important element in this OVA, the gel. Even though the gel remains a constant symbol throughout the show, the manipulation of it allows idols to develop and define their different relations with the followers independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s dive deeper into this &lt;del&gt;and I will show you how I misinterpret everything&lt;/del&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miho - Consumerism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
Nothing can describe the relationship between Miho and its fans better than the one between producers and consumers. The success of Miho, a heartless and mindless robot controlled by the real &amp;ldquo;Miho&amp;rdquo;, mocked the idol business for mass producing idols whose personalities and appearances are all manufactured in order to create a fake character that attracts people to consume. If you go further, it is also a fairly accurate depiction of the modern anime industry too since we can all see how the market is overwhelmed by loli themed slice-of-life shows with no content, isekai shows with the same plot, or just straight up soft porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the idol is selling self as a product that can be purchased via gel. The more gel it extracts, the more profits the company makes. Sadly we don&amp;rsquo;t have gel extracting machines in real life and gel is just a more graphical measurement of how much people are willing to mentally invest in Miho, the product. But as you see in the OVA, over-extracting gel makes people weak, symbolizing self destruction led by extreme consumerism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mima Women - Religion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
To be specific, I meant Key&amp;rsquo;s mother and grandma, both are mikos who hold supernatural power but lost it when being brought to Tokyo when Dr Mima tried to conduct experiments on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, the Mima women are walking gel-extracting machines who perform miracles through gels acquired from the people around them. Without the magical ability to absorb gel, Mimas are just ordinary women, but not &amp;ldquo;idols&amp;rdquo; who are being worshiped and respected. This somehow reminds me of Suwako in Touhou a little bit, that cute frog god who can only remain powerful through faith and would disappear without enough faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Miho, Mimas have escaped the fate of being a mere product as idols. To me, the relation between Mimas and their believers represent a balanced transformation of power. Gel is not simply a golden ticket for the simps anymore, but a sincere dedication and bond to each other that both parties share. The action of physically extracting gel symbolizes the religious process of gaining faith. Here we can ask ourself a question: will God be dead once no one takes faith in him and worship him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key - ???&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to find a word to precisely summarize Key&amp;rsquo;s relationship with her followers. She has only presented herself as an idol for a short time during her singing the lullaby and returning &amp;ldquo;omoi&amp;rdquo; to 30,000 people. Compared to Miho and Mimas, Key does not acquire characteristics of an idol and only takes the idol&amp;rsquo;s journey for self completion, that is to fulfill her grandfather&amp;rsquo;s dying wish and to return to a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Key and her audiences resembles the one between Mimas and their followers, yet in this case, it somehow transcends religion and focuses more on mutual goods. I wish I could phrase it better, but the ability of Key releasing the gel gives a new definition to idols as she voluntarily returns the power back to its owners. The power once again returns to balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how to make my music critique sound sophisticated, so all I could say is that the soundtracks are amazing. I really liked &amp;ldquo;Lullaby&amp;rdquo; , &amp;ldquo;Memories of Sand&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Flower of the Night&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time when an anime attracts me more by its music but not its content was when I watched &lt;em&gt;CLANNAD&lt;/em&gt;. Great soundcracks, yet I am not quite satisfied for what I got after watching 48 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mima-and-mima&#34;&gt;Mima and Mima&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend talked with me over the similarities between Mima Kirigoe in &lt;em&gt;Perfect Blue&lt;/em&gt; and Tokiko (Key) Mima. Very interesting discussion, and I bet he is reading this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mima and Mima alliance shows confusion and conflict with oneself. Both Mima fail to live or find a true self due to suppression from different sources. To Mima, it&amp;rsquo;s her manager, the industry, the fans, and a more realistic vision that hinters her from achieving her dream as an actress; and to Key, it&amp;rsquo;s her grandfather&amp;rsquo;s wish, support from her friend, and the belief in the lie of her being a robot that forbids her to question her heart more closely: is this what I really want to do? Key is portrayed as a rather blank girl whose entire life has no highlights or achievements, that you could argue that even the wish of making 30,000 friends is not part of her will.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Alternative Interpretation of Kon Satoshi&#39;s Perfect Blue (Part 2)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post contains lots of pictures&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want my post to be too long so I decided to split it into two parts&lt;/em&gt;
You can find the first part at &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post/an-alternative-interpretation-of-kon-satoshis-perfect-blue-part-1/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Bind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
Throughout the film, &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt; has played an important role at developing Mima&amp;rsquo;s character and strengthening her schizophrenia as it closely correlates to Mima&amp;rsquo;s own dilemma. They are so perfectly related that some people have argued that &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt; is the real story plot while Mima, Rumi, and whatever characters that exist outside of the film are all inside Youko&amp;rsquo;s head. It is an interesting viewpoint, but here I am going to argue that &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt; is a reflection of real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s unconsciousness involving her most unpleasant memory as opposed to Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room: a reflection of real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot of &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt; is rather simple and can be summarized as followed:
Youko is an ordinary girl who has always envied her sister, a top model. One day she is invited to be a model herself. However, one day while she is performing in a strip club, she gets raped. The rape causes her to develop multiple personality disorder and use it as an excuse to kill her sister and peel her. She imagines herself as an actual model (just like her sister) to escape the fact that she is raped. After that, Youko also hallucinates about a murderer who kills her sister and reflects the illusion of this inexistent murderer to the men who raped her. To retaliate, she decides to kill those men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe not that simple. But how is it relating to real Rumi? My hypothesis will be that real Rumi aimed to be a perfect idol like Mimarin when she was young but completely lost her mind after being raped by Me-Mania. It sounds like a crazy idea, but does explains Me-Mania&amp;rsquo;s constant appearance in real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s fantasy yet without interacting with her. While sitting there watching Mima&amp;rsquo;s acting of getting raped, Rumi is re-experiencing her own trauma which at the mean time reminds her of the presence of Me-Mania in her fantasy. Instead of eliminating him, real Rumi has later manipulated Me-Mania to kill Mima, which fits the plot where Youko imagines a murderer while herself is the one who truly did the killings.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166077343.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s past and her fantasy combined becomes an exact clone of &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt;. Her rape by Me-Mania is reflected through the rape scene at the stripe club; her fantasy on Rumi and Mimarin is reflected by Youko&amp;rsquo;s multiple personality disorder; the reflection of Mimarin, a perfect idol as her younger self is reflected by Youko&amp;rsquo;s fantasy on her sister, a perfect model; Me-Mania who exists in her unconscious mind that later tries to murder and rape Mima is reflected by the illusionary murderer Youko has created who possesses the bodies of those who raped her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lines of &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt; can be both helpful at understanding the film and misleading at the same time.Kon is a master at blurring boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time Mima hallucinates about Me-Mania, which implies the interconnection established by Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room. Ironically, Youko&amp;rsquo;s psychiatrist is saying to her that illusions cannot come to life. I have stated earlier that Mima does not exist and is a doppelganger of Mimarin, while Me-Mania once existed and has raped real Rumi. The illusion mentioned here is more likely to be foreshadowing Mima&amp;rsquo;s escape from Rumi&amp;rsquo;s fantasy to the reality as an &amp;ldquo;illusion&amp;rdquo; who has no physical body.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166099930.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166111983.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went on with the doctor discussing the murder with the police in &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt;. The doctor says that illusions can&amp;rsquo;t kill and explains that the illusion finds someone to possess. This line means what I said earlier, that Youko has reflected the imaginary murderer to the men who raped her and killed these men who her sister&amp;rsquo;s justice. It also applies to real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s thinking process. She can manipulate Mimarin or Rumi to accomplish the murder but instead she chose Me-Mania as the container to possess her desire of killing Mima. The reason here is that if she lets characters who directly reflect her kill Mima, a divided persona from her own, it is no different than committing suicide. To Youko, retaliating for her sister means committing suicide and that&amp;rsquo;s why she has decided to create a murderer mentally and reflect him to people who she hates and can kill without remorse. This is what Rumi does, that she kills Me-Mania after he fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here comes one of the most confusing part of the film: the conversation between the doctor and Youko. It has been repeated twice in the film. The first time Mima refers to herself as &amp;ldquo;Mima, an actress&amp;rdquo; and the second time she refers to herself as &amp;ldquo;Rika, an model&amp;rdquo;. Here is the conversation from the first time.

&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166253119.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166285240.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166298279.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166316223.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166332569.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I previously claimed, &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt; is a reflection of real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s unconsciousness that helps Mima gain self consciousness through the character Youko. Conversations from the second time is the original plot that truly applies to real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s unconsciousness while conversations from the first time (shown by the screenshots) is a modified version by Mima. It proves that at this point, Mima is not simply a puppet controlled by real Rumi and all her reflected characters, but a &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; individual who has the ability to think and realize her own existence. Her mind is yet immature, that even though she acquires self awareness, she cannot clearly distinguish herself from the character Youko or Mimarin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the Chaos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
We are gradually reaching the climax of the movie as we wander further into this bizarre fantasy. In this stage, Mima completely loses her direction on the boundary of reality, illusion, and &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt;. It is a series of chaos and confusion that finally leads to Mima&amp;rsquo;s liberation from real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I counted all the scenes where Mima wakes up from her bed and took screenshots of each one of them. As you can see, Mima always wakes up from the same room with slightly different setup and during different time. People with the drug theory have used this as an evidence to support their claim that Rumi feeds Mima sleeping pills while she takes the role of Mima. I actually agree with the idea that Mima might have waken up in different rooms (Rumi&amp;rsquo;s), but for a more psychological reason. It is possible that the website &amp;ldquo;Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room&amp;rdquo; has interfered and connected Mima&amp;rsquo;s room in real life, which indicates that not only the mind of Mima and Rumi, but also the actual room of Mima and Rumi are now interconnected. It is hard for us or even for Mima to notice, because their rooms are identical. The curtain on the third and the fourth picture proves my point because it is only the scenery outside of the windows that can help us determine the owner of the room and with the curtain covering it, we can conclude nothing.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166358000.png&#34; alt=&#34;first time&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166424596.png&#34; alt=&#34;second time&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166460821.png&#34; alt=&#34;third time&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166476839.png&#34; alt=&#34;fourth time&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous post I left off at the point where Me-Mania receives email about Mima complaining, and I will pick up from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mima&amp;rsquo;s former idol group is interviewing for a podcast and Mima again sees Mimarin. She chases Mimarin through the crowd and a truck rushes toward her. On the truck, we can see Me-Mania on the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat. After the car hits her, Mima wakes up and thus the first chaos ends.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166503758.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Me-Mania&amp;rsquo;s attack, I have an interesting idea. It is a reflection of real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s memory and Mimarin leads Mima to experience it. After real Rumi has been raped by Me-Mania, she is desperate for any kind of help and to eliminate this trouble, Me-Mania decides to kill her by faking a car accident. However, it fails and real Rumi ends up with a damaged brain and deteriorated mental health, which causes her to come up with this fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her first wakeup, Mima has a discussion with Rumi and while she finishes, a voice says to her that illusion can&amp;rsquo;t come to life and the scene jumps to Mima at the movie with the actress who acts for the doctor in &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt;. Then the director shouts &amp;ldquo;take 2&amp;rdquo; and thus the second chaos ends.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166524886.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166540018.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166548180.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mima&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on illusion applies to herself, a second persona developed from Mimarin that starts to act on her own. The interruption of the movie line signifies that Mima&amp;rsquo;s mind has been intermingled with Youko&amp;rsquo;s and from now on, whenever she feels perplexed or threatened, she will switch to Youko for defense. The word &amp;ldquo;take x&amp;rdquo; is repeatedly used in the following scenes and it represents Mima&amp;rsquo;s switch back to the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her second wakeup, Mima again is having a conversation with Rumi. The scene then switches to her reading the website. According to the website, she is shopping at Harajuku today.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166560401.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It then switches to &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt; and as it slowly fades out from the screen, we see the photographer that has taken nudes of Mima watching this drama. A pizza guy comes and stabs him. After some bloody scenes, here comes the famous scene of Mima stabbing the photographer while &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt; is playing at the background and random pictures of Mima&amp;rsquo;s nudes flash in between.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166573610.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture of Mima shopping at Harajuku baffles me the most. If I follow my theory, there is no need to let Mima consider herself a scapegoat if Rumi is planning to kill her anyway. It would be Mimarin, the perfect yet arrogant and naive younger self of real Rumi, who decides to play this childish prank on Mima and misguides Mima to believe that she has committed the murder unconsciously while Rumi the mentor takes the role of killer that requires one to be more rational and logical. Kon used some interesting metaphor in the screenshot above and why not having some fun misinterpret everything. My hypothesis would be that it is a representation of a unified state in which three personas combine and establish harmony. The face filled with anger represents Mimarin, the one who is overwhelmed by repugnance toward people who destroyed her purity yet being physically powerless; the thick body represents Rumi, the one who serves as the cold hearted executer yet also a protector of her supposed younger self Mimarin; the face with tears on the screen represents Mima, the one who is locked inside a fantasy and seeks her own unique identity yet being oppressed by the &amp;ldquo;main characters&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her third wakeup, Mima received a call telling her that the photographer has been killed. Remembered what happened last night, Mima checks her closet and discovers the same bag she has seen on the Harajuku photo except that it now contains a coat with blood on it.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166588552.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists are outside her apartment and Mima surprisingly finds the door locked. In the film production studio, Mima is asked to act as she just killed someone and while she focuses on the fake corpse, she starts to hallucinate the photographer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I ask you to look close. The bag on the Harajuku photo has dots between each letter while the one inside Mima&amp;rsquo;s closet has none. It is probably just a mistake, but I think I could conclude that it is the evidence of my previous claim that Mima and Rumi&amp;rsquo;s room are interconnected. This is not Mimarin&amp;rsquo;s bag, but Rumi&amp;rsquo;s. Mima has waken up this time in Rumi&amp;rsquo;s room because otherwise Mimarin should have put the bag in Mima&amp;rsquo;s room and the bag should have dots on it. The locked door is another evidence because Mima does not have the habit of double locking her door. The film scene here is the imagination of Mima rather than a reflection of real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s unconsciousness as Mima slowly gains dominance over directing the film and tries to convince herself that the killing she has witnessed is merely a part of the drama plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her fourth wakeup, we encounter the conversation I explained above in the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; section. The movie is announced to be officially finished after that. Mima meets Eri (the woman who played doctor in &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt;) on the hallway and she tells her again that illusions can&amp;rsquo;t come to life while Mima mistakenly calls her film name. Me-Mania appears on the other side of the hallway and when Mima tries to seek help from Eri, Eri disappears. Me-Mania grabs her and attempts to rape and kill her.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166604559.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mima struggles and manages to escape by beating his head with a hammer. Suddenly &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt; is again to be announced to be finished. Mima finds Rumi and when they go together to check the stage, it looks like nothing has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie has finished twice in the above scenes. I would argue that the movie ends the first time to Rumi, and ends the second time for Mima. The first end represents the end of the projection of real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s unconsciousness and the second end represents Mima&amp;rsquo;s graduation from an immature persona. Eri&amp;rsquo;s disappearance is the last time Mima has failed to differentiate between reality and fiction as Eri has not been there for the entire time. The end of the drama liberates Me-Mania from real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s unconsciousness and allows him to better interact with Mima in the conscious region for the reasons I have listed in the previous section. I interpret the disappearance of Me-Mania&amp;rsquo;s corpse this way: Mima has gained self control and is no longer acting upon the supervision of real Rumi. Rumi has no knowledge of Mima&amp;rsquo;s doings and assumes that Mima would not dare to kill Me-Mania. Therefore we have a bug in real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s fantasy and Mima is the one who causes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her fifth wakeup, she is in Rumi&amp;rsquo;s room and gets the news that Tadokoro (Mima&amp;rsquo;s agent who pushes her to be an actress) and Me-Mania died with a stab in eyes.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166619478.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About time to enter the climax. Rumi enters wearing clothes Mimarin has worn and behaves like her, which scares Mima.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166627985.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumi proceeds to chase Mima with a weapon in hand trying to kill her. During the chase, Rumi&amp;rsquo;s appearance keeps switching between herself and Mimarin. Finally, Rumi hurts herself and starts to hallucinate being on a stage while standing in front of a truck. Mima saved her and the movie ends by Mima vising the mental hospital and displaying her creepy smile.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1622166638711.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Me-Mania died again proves that Rumi is not aware of what happened on the stage that goes &amp;ldquo;off the plot&amp;rdquo;. It is reasonable for Mimarin and Rumi reunite for the sake of eliminating Mima as the situation gets uncontrollable. However, it fails again. Miserably. As Rumi&amp;rsquo;s fantasy starts to collapse, we are taking the trip back to hospital, a reality where Mima now exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, I&amp;rsquo;m real!&amp;rdquo; said by Mima the illusionary antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for spending your time. I hope I didn&amp;rsquo;t bore you by pulling out all kinds of details. &lt;em&gt;Perfect Blue&lt;/em&gt; is one of my favorite movie and I was feeling really excited writing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have encouraged you at the beginning to read other &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; analysis before reading mine. This is a completely alternative interpretation that just tries to mess around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next time my illusionary readers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Alternative Interpretation of Kon Satoshi&#39;s Perfect Blue (Part 1)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post contains lots of pictures&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want my post to be too long so I decided to split it into two parts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620612704545.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
Recently I rewatched &lt;em&gt;Perfect Blue&lt;/em&gt;, a psychological film directed by Satoshi Kon published in 1997. If you know nothing about this film, it is basically a story centered around Mima Kirigoe, an idol who decided to quit and became an actress but developed multiple personality disorder during this process of transformation. Unless you don&amp;rsquo;t mind getting spoilers or understanding absolutely nothing of what I am going to say next, I highly recommend you to watch the film before proceeding to read the rest of this post or at least reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Blue#Plot&#34;&gt;the plot part of wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfect Blue&lt;/em&gt; is a masterpiece of apparition, identity, consciousness, and horror, which at the same time ambiguates the theme and makes the entire film difficult to understand. Satoshi Kon&amp;rsquo;s technique also perfectly accomplished the task of trapping his audiences into an overlapping realm of illusion and reality. Even after reaching the end, Satoshi Kon still refuses to give us a satisfying answer on whether or not Mima has her mind returned to reality as he decided to make that famous smile an opening ending question.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620612767692.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have given out a variety of interpretation and analysis on this film with different focuses, while most of them share the following conception:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kirigoe Mima exists and is real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mimarin existed as a persona and is fake after Mima pursues the career of an actress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rumi exists and is real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me-Mania exists and is real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Youko (Mima&amp;rsquo;s character in &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt;) does not exist and is fake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have found some alternative opinions that have completely flipped the existing common conception, almost all of them are fragments of hypothesis with minimum evidence accompanied rather than a complete theory like the &amp;ldquo;all-characters-exist-and-Rumi-is-the-bad-one&amp;rdquo; theories you can find everywhere on the internet. There are two main theories in this category, one holds the point that everything is an illusion of Youko, and the other one holds the point that everything is an illusion of Rumi. The former one is plausible but I found it hard to connect all the pieces together, so I am more leaning toward the second one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As what you might have already guessed from the title, today I am going to complete (or at least trying to) this alternative theory by taking a relook at the plot and all the details while not going too deep into the analysis of psychology, philosophy, or symbology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Framework&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the third and fifth common conception applies to my explanation of this film. In this alternative interpretation, nothing &amp;ldquo;exists&amp;rdquo; and everything is &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; except the final scene where Rumi is placed in a mental hospital. The entire film is merely a misty reproduction of Rumi&amp;rsquo;s past modified by Rumi to ease the pain she has experienced from the collapse of her dream and career as an idol, unpleasant memory of being sexually harassed and raped, and the lack of a mentor that guides her on her way toward maturity. However, as Mima gains consciousness from acting in the drama, she manages to escape from Rumi&amp;rsquo;s fantasy and directly interact with the reality. The modified version is as followed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirigoe Mima didn&amp;rsquo;t exist and was not real until the end of the film.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mimarin doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist and is not real.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rumi exists and is real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me-Mania existed and was real.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Youko does not exist and is fake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film can be divided into three sections in my opinion: &lt;strong&gt;before the chaos&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Bind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;after the chaos&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Before the chaos&amp;rdquo; indicates the beginning part of the movie where Mima still appears conscious of herself; &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; indicates the content of the drama Mima takes part in; and &amp;ldquo;After the Chaos&amp;rdquo; indicates the ending part of the movie where illusion and reality are mixed up and Mima keeps waking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid confusion, I will call each persona/character by the following name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mima&lt;/em&gt;: the one who decides to quit singing and become an actress and gets illusions of herself as an idol (the one that splits from Mimarin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mimarin&lt;/em&gt;: the persona of Mima as an idol (real Rumis&amp;rsquo;s reflection of younger self)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rumi&lt;/em&gt;: Mima&amp;rsquo;s manager who always accompanies her (real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s reflection of self)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;real Rumi&lt;/em&gt;: the one who is in the mental hospital, the entire film is a fantasy of hers based on her past&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before the Chaos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the movie (or to be more clear, the beginning of Rumi&amp;rsquo;s fantasy), Mimarin, is doing her last performance with the group.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620612855735.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shot keeps switching among the performance of the girls, the conversation Rumi has with the other manager on Mima, and the creepy man Me-Mania. Real Rumi reflects her younger self on the persona of Mimarin and takes complete control upon her because she is able to directly copy all her memory as an idol and thoughts to her. Rumi, a persona that real Rumi has also complete control upon due to the same reason, serves as a mentor that is absent from real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s past. For all other characters that appear in the film involving Mima who splits from Mimarin, real Rumi takes only part of the control as she does not directly represent any of them. Me-Mania is an exception due to real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s reluctance to recall him from her past. He exists only in real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s unconsciousness and materializes in her fantasy without real Rumi realizing until a certain point we will discuss later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are constantly seeing signs alluding the irrationality of this fake reality in the film. After the performance ends, Mima hears a mysterious man&amp;rsquo;s voice saying &amp;ldquo;I am always looking into Mima&amp;rsquo;s room&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620612888040.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she arrives home, she receives a mysterious call that has no voice coming through but a man&amp;rsquo;s heavy breath, a letter that says the same thing as the voice, and a mysterious fax that prints &amp;ldquo;traitor&amp;rdquo; over and over.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620612908782.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three incidents display an incoherence and remains unsolved even until the end of the film. The fax is arguable and it can be possibly from Rumi, but I think I could safely say that the voice, the call, the letter, and the fax are all part of real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s unconsciousness that accuses her younger self of quitting the idol group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shot now switches to Mima practicing her lines for Youko. There is only one line for her: &amp;ldquo;Who are you&amp;rdquo;. As Mima repeats this line, her personality starts to mingle with Youko and thus diminishes her obedience to real Rumi. By questioning &amp;ldquo;Who are you&amp;rdquo; not only to the drama character but also to herself, Mima develops her own memories, personality, and mindset that is separate from those of real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620612930931.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly something explodes and Tadokoro (the manager) gets hurt. Mima hurries to where Tadokoro falls and picks up a piece of paper that has &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;is a warning. The next one will be real&amp;rdquo; written on it.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620612948190.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620612960810.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Real Rumi has manipulated Rumi to accomplish all the killings of people that once hurt her in the past, including this incident. It marks the beginning of real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mima purchases a new computer and asks Rumi to teach her. Here comes one of the most important component of the film: the website &amp;ldquo;Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620613022228.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many possible ways to interpret Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room, but I believe that Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room does not exist on the public internet and has no real author. It is a manifestation of real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s mind while Mimarin serves as a protocol that regulates connection across the LAN, on which people can access the website. Through Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room, everyone on the LAN can be interconnected and exchange information recorded on Mima&amp;rsquo;s diary. So far only three people are shown in the film accessing the website: Mima, Rumi, and Me-Mania. All three of them have experienced illusions of Mimarin after or while reading the website so I stated that Mimarin is the protocol. Me-Mania doesn&amp;rsquo;t share the full right to both read and modify the content because his own mind is still shackled in the unconscious section of real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s mind yet Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room is a representation of consciousness that real Rumi has dominant control upon. Me-Mania&amp;rsquo;s presence on the LAN also partially explains why Mima hallucinates about Me-Mania before she is in physical contact with him. It is Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room that bridges their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said that the website is not real because of some details that are so minor to a point you can just consider them irrelevant bugs the director is too busy to even take care of. If you take a really close look to the picture of Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room above, you can see that the website has 12069 visitors. Now pay close attention to all times where Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room appear and you will notice that the visitor number has been stuck at 12069. Take another look in that screenshot and you can see that the last update date is 96/05/07. However, the last diary entry Mima reads is from 05/12, the date she attends the drama production. They are two signs of incoherence that indicate the false existence of Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room. As I said, they probably don&amp;rsquo;t even matter but I am going to take every detail seriously like a real nerd. You can&amp;rsquo;t stop me.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620613008032.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After accessing Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room, Mima has her first hallucination of Mimarin on her way to the drama production studio. This solidifies my theory on how Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room interconnects people&amp;rsquo;s minds and Mimarin serves as the protocol.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620613042130.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drama director has asked Mima to participate in a rape scene. Even though Rumi is strongly against this suggestion, Mima agrees. This is a critical point of Mima&amp;rsquo;s transformation from Mimarin as an idol to Mima as an actress. Idols are symbols of purity yet Mima&amp;rsquo;s acceptance of being involved in a rape scene deprives her of such quality, which also leads her to be taken nudes later in the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the acting, Rumi has cried and got away from her seat as the scene becomes too aggressive and unbearable. I will talk more about this in the &lt;em&gt;Double Bind&lt;/em&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mima goes home and tries to appear cheerful, but after seeing her fish died, she loses her mind and begins to cry. The illusion of Mimarin appears again on the computer screen, mocking Mima for being a whore. Suddenly the scene switches to the fish tank and even though the previous shot has shown that all fish are dead, there are two fishes happily swimming inside the tank and no dead fish is present. I would take this as a representation of the duality of real Rumi (Mimarin and Rumi) that warns Mima to obey to the persona of Mimarin. The disappearance of dead fish is yet another incoherence that real Rumi produces unconsciously.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620613065537.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the rape scene, the first death emerges. The script writer of the drama is found dead in the elevator with his eyes poked. Many believe that this murder is accomplished by Me-Mania because of the shot of Me-Mania reading Mima&amp;rsquo;s Room, on which Mima complains about being forced to participate in the rape scene. In order to make my theory plausible, I would have to say that Rumi is the criminal behind all these murders. Real Rumi produces this fantasy to temporarily forget the trauma she once experienced and the murders are part of her revenge toward people who have caused her suffering. In order to reinforce the role of Rumi as the guardian, real Rumi designates her to do all those dirty stuff while maintaining the purity of Mimarin, who should have the most hatred toward people who are involved in tarnishing her.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620613174903.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here comes my personal favorite part of the film. Mima accepts the offer to be taken photos for a magazine while the photographer is notorious for letting all his models strip. Meanwhile the rest of the idol group is performing on the stage while Me-Mania is among the audiences. The shots keep switching between the photographer taking nudes of Mima and the group performing on the stage, signifying the official death of Mima and also real Rumi&amp;rsquo;s idol career as real Rumi has exactly the same experience as Mima. As the film progresses, Mima starts to hallucinate more about Mimarin. While she is resting after taking the photos, Mimarin appears at the door and opens the door while smiling. The shot switches to the stage, where Mimarin joins them and sings with them. The Mimarin on the stage is reflected by Me-Mania.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.tapiocanation.xyz/post-images/1620613187112.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me-Mania receives an email from Mima saying that the Mima he now sees is an imposter and asking him what she should do. He replies that he will get rid of her. The email is drafted by the conscious mind of real Rumi(so either Rumi or Mimarin sends the email) as she slowly notices Mima&amp;rsquo;s psychological separation from Mimarin and the existence of Me-Mania in her fantasy. Despite her disdain of Me-Mania due to her unpleasant memory of him that we will talk about later, she has still decided to manipulate Me-Mania to execute Mima before she completely loses control of her behavior and thoughts.
