      I have been using Arch as my daily drive for a while and decided to venture a little bit by trying out Gentoo. My first Gentoo installation went semi-successfully, so I want to record my installation process here in case I encounter the same problem in the future. Therefore, this post serves a purpose more of a personal record than a guide. With that being said, you are welcome to follow it.

Double Bind Throughout the film, Double Bind has played an important role at developing Mima&rsquo;s character and strengthening her schizophrenia as it closely correlates to Mima&rsquo;s own dilemma. They are so perfectly related that some people have argued that Double Bind is the real story plot while Mima, Rumi, and whatever characters that exist outside of the film are all inside Youko&rsquo;s head.

Recently I rewatched Perfect Blue, a psychological film directed by Satoshi Kon published in 1997. If you know nothing about this film, it is basically a story centered around Mima Kirigoe, an idol who decided to quit and became an actress but developed multiple personality disorder during this process of transformation.

      V2ray is &ldquo;a platform for building proxies to bypass network restrictions&rdquo;. You can find the github page here, the official English website here, and also here. As you might have noticed, v2ray is not a tool invented primarily for privacy (but it is very tweakable for all kinds of purposes), bur is rather used to bypass the GFW in China. Most of you will never use it probably, but it is always fun to try new things, am I right?

      Until now, the World Wide Web relies on HTTP to transfer data and establish communication across the web. But in 2015, an American guy named Juan Benet created a new protocol called IPFS, or you might like its sci-fi sounding name better, &ldquo;InterPlanetary File System&rdquo;, to compete with HTTP. Instead of the classic server-client approach, IPFS decides to go with peer-to-peer, which should sound familiar if you know BitTorrent. To summarize it in a short sentence, IPFS is a peer-to-peer file sharing system that claims to be faster, safer, and more open.

      If you have been following up on news recently (well, maybe not that recent), you might have already heard an overwhelming amount of reports that concerns censorship involving Trump ban; removal of Parler, a right wing social media platform that gains reputation during Capitol riots; removal of &ldquo;When Harry became Sally&rdquo;, a controversial book criticized for its transphobia; and the most recent one is the removal of Dr. Seuss&rsquo;s six books that &ldquo;portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong&rdquo; according to Dr.

      So as you can see, I have decided to give gridea a try since it looks easy to configure and use. It&rsquo;&rsquo;s a great static blog writing client for lazy people and non-techies. They should really promote themselves more instead of only focusing on Chinese users but somehow they didn&rsquo;t even manage to add English translation to their website.
Btw they support linux.
I guess I will use it for few more weeks and decide if I like it or not.
