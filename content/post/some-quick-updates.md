- The personal website/landing page is migrated to a different VPS.
- Cloudflare service is now completely yeeted. I should have done this earlier.
- Well yeah you could figure out these on your own but I felt like announcing them.
- I was browsing some newsletter softwares and they all look very soy. Most of my readers use RSS anyway so I wouldn't venture into it. 
- I reread my first post and realized that I am failing my promise. Maybe I will try to update more frequently.
- Thank you for supporting the blog :>
